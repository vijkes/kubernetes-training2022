====================================================================================================================

Rampad (rolling update)
recreate 

are bydefault deployment strategies

Recreate: first delete all the old container and then create a new one
and also has some downtime

Rolling update: if you don't want to face downtime 

As soon as we launch deployment internally they launch 
a replica set and ask a replica set to launch the pod

Deployment only duty is to provide the strategies, 
it doesn't know how to launch the pods, how to replicate, 
or run services

Types of deployment:
Rampad
Recreate
Blue-green
Canary
A/B testing
